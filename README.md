#PictureTrip

This tool enables the creation of a slideshow video (.mp4) from a folder of pictures using ffmpeg. The user can set the framerate and the resolution of the resulting video (via a GUI or the terminal interface).

#TODO
Rotation is read from .EXIF-Tags from pictures, but they are not scaled properly now...
